# ds_mod_12_noSQL
Homework for week 12 of the data analysis bootcamp 2024 - noSQL

All deliverables are located in the 'submission' folder.

In this challenge I used jupyter notebooks and MongoDB to create and query a database containing data about food establishments in London. 
I first set up a database using MongDB on my local host and then uploaded the data using python code. After the inital uploaing of the data I then did some various data cleaning to make sure any null values didnt cause a problem. I also changed some datatypes to make analysis easier. All of the set up is found in the **NoSQL_setup_starter_SUB** file. 

After the setup I then began my analysis. I wrote several queries in the notebook to look at hygine scores and establishment rating. All of the analysis is located in the **NoSQL_analysis_starter_SUB** file.
